# Stochastic Volatility Models

This repository contains Python implementations of various stochastic volatility models for financial time series analysis. These models are designed to capture the randomness in volatility observed in asset prices over time, and are widely used in quantitative finance, risk management, and option pricing.

## Overview


## Models Implemented

The following stochastic volatility models are currently available in this repository:

- **Merton Jump Diffusion:**

- **Continous-Time Markov Chains:**

- **Heston Model:** In this model the volatility has its own stochastic differential equation, creating a smoother yet still random transition between times of high volatility an low volatility. An important characteristic of this model is tha t



## Distributions
The distributions of each model are also investigated to ensure that that the stochastic models are performing as expected.

## To-Do

There are still a few ways in which
